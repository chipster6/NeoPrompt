# Optimizer (V2 roadmap)

This document outlines the V2 optimizer direction (M5 â€” explainable optimizer) and links to the legacy v1 bandit notes.

- Goals: explainable operator selection and improvement suggestions with rationales and diffs
- Interfaces: /optimize, /optimize/accept (see NeoPrompt_TechSpecV2.md)
- Signals: quality components (specificity, structure, ambiguity_inverse, actionability, consistency)
- Governance: required operators and accept criteria for changes

Legacy (v1) documentation has been moved to docs/legacy/optimizer_v1.md.

Legacy v1 (for reference) content has moved. See docs/legacy/optimizer_v1.md.
